# Quiz #3 - University and Student classes

This Java program defines `Student` and `University` classes in the package `oop.q3`.

- The `Student` class stores student information.
- The `University` class manages a list of students and includes a method `getStudentInfoStrange` that behaves differently depending on if the student is yourself or others.
- The `Main` class demonstrates usage and tests all functionality.
